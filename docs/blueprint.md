## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Electric Blue (`#1E40AF`) - more sophisticated than your vibrant blue, represents trust and innovation while being easier on the eyes
- Secondary color: Bright Purple (`#8B5CF6`) - adds energy and creativity, perfect for a student-focused platform
- Background color: Pure White (`#FFFFFF`) with Subtle Gray (`#F8FAFC`) for sections - cleaner and more modern than light gray

- Accent colors: Warning Orange (`#F59E0B`) for attention-grabbing elements
- Accent colors: Neutral Gray (`#6B7280`) for secondary text
- Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif - more modern and readable than PT Sans, used by many tech companies
- Headline font: 'Satoshi' or 'Cal Sans' for a fresh, startup-friendly feel (fallback: 'Space Grotesk')
- Rounded corners (8px-16px radius) for a friendly, approachable feel
- Subtle gradients and glassmorphism effects
- Modern line icons with consistent stroke width
- Card-based layout with soft shadows (0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.05))
